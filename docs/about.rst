About
=====

Elasticsearch Curator helps you curate, or manage, your Elasticsearch indices and snapshots by:

1. Obtaining the full list of indices (or snapshots) from the cluster, as the *actionable list*

2. Iterate through a list of user-defined filters to progressively remove indices (or snapshots)
   from this *actionable list* as needed.

3. Perform various :doc:`actions </actions>` on the items which remain in the *actionable list.*
