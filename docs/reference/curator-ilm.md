# Curator and index lifecycle management [ilm]

Beginning with Elasticsearch version 6.6, Elasticsearch has provided [Index Lifecycle Management](docs-content://manage-data/lifecycle/index-lifecycle-management.md) (ILM) to users with at least a Basic license. ILM provides users with many of the most common index management features as a matter of policy, rather than execution time analysis (which is how Curator works).
