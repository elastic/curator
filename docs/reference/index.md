# Curator index management

This section provides reference information for Elasticsearch Curator.

## Versions [versions]

Elasticsearch Curator has been around for many different versions of Elasticsearch. Earlier releases of Curator supported multiple versions of Elasticsearch, but this is no longer the case.

Curator is now major version locked with Elasticsearch, which means that if Curatorâ€™s major version is 8, it should support any Elasticsearch 8.x release.

### Current release [current_release]

The current version of Curator v8 is 8.0.17.
