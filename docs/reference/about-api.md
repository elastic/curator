# Application Program Interface (API) [about-api]

Curator ships with both an API and CLI tool.  The API, or Application Program Interface, allows you to write your own scripts to accomplish similar goals—​or even new and different things—​with the same code that Curator uses.

The API documentation is not on this site, but is available at [http://curator.readthedocs.io/](http://curator.readthedocs.io/).  The Curator API is built using the [Elasticsearch Python API](http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/python-api/current/index.md).
