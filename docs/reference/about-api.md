# Application Program Interface (API) [about-api]

Curator ships with both an API and CLI tool.  The API, or Application Program Interface, allows you to write your own scripts to accomplish similar goals—or even new and different things—with the same code that Curator uses.

The API documentation is not on this site, but is available at [http://curator.readthedocs.io/](http://curator.readthedocs.io/).  The Curator API is built using the [Elasticsearch Python API](elasticsearch-py://index.md).
