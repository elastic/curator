# Installation [installation]

Curator can be installed in a variety of ways, depending on what meets your needs.  It is important to note that Curator only requires access to a client node in the Elasticsearch cluster to work.  It does not need to be installed on one of the nodes in the cluster.

* [pip](/reference/pip.md), the easiest way to use and upgrade.
* [Source Code](/reference/python-source.md)
* [Docker](/reference/docker.md)
