# Installation from source [python-source]

You can instal Curator from a source tarball (rather than doing a `git clone`).


1. Download the Curator tarball:
```sh subs=true
wget https://github.com/elastic/curator/archive/v{{version.curator}}.tar.gz -O elasticsearch-curator.tar.gz
```
2. Install the tarball:
```sh
pip install elasticsearch-curator.tar.gz
```
