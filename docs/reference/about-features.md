# Features [about-features]

Curator allows for many different operations to be performed to both indices and snapshots, including:

* Add or remove indices (or both!) from an [alias](/reference/alias.md)
* Change shard routing [allocation](/reference/allocation.md)
* [Close](/reference/close.md) indices
* [Create index](/reference/create_index.md)
* [Delete indices](/reference/delete_indices.md)
* [Delete snapshots](/reference/delete_snapshots.md)
* [Open](/reference/open.md) closed indices
* [forceMerge](/reference/forcemerge.md) indices
* [reindex](/reference/reindex.md) indices, including from remote clusters
* Change the number of [replicas](/reference/replicas.md) per shard for indices
* [rollover](/reference/rollover.md) indices
* Take a [snapshot](/reference/snapshot.md) (backup) of indices
* [Restore](/reference/restore.md) snapshots
* [Shrink](/reference/shrink.md) indices
