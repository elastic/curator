Elasticsearch Curator Python API
================================

The Elasticsearch Curator Python API helps you manage your indices and
snapshots.

.. note::

   This documentation is for the Elasticsearch Curator Python API.  Documentation
   for the Elasticsearch Curator *CLI* -- which uses this API and is installed
   as an entry_point as part of the package -- is available in the
   `Elastic guide`_.

.. _Elastic guide: http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/curator/current/index.html

Compatibility
-------------

The Elasticsearch Curator Python API is compatible with Elasticsearch version 8.x,
and supports Python versions 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11 officially.

Installation
------------

Install the ``elasticsearch-curator`` package with `pip
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/elasticsearch-curator>`_::

    pip install elasticsearch-curator

Example Usage
-------------

::

    import elasticsearch
    import curator

    client = elasticsearch.Elasticsearch()

    ilo = curator.IndexList(client)
    ilo.filter_by_regex(kind='prefix', value='logstash-')
    ilo.filter_by_age(source='name', direction='older', timestring='%Y.%m.%d', unit='days', unit_count=30)
    delete_indices = curator.DeleteIndices(ilo)
    delete_indices.do_action()

.. TIP::
    See more examples in the :doc:`Examples </examples>` page.

Features
--------

The API methods fall into the following categories:

* :doc:`Object Classes </objectclasses>` build and filter index list or snapshot list objects.
* :doc:`Action Classes </actionclasses>` act on object classes.
* :doc:`Utilities </utilities>` are helper methods.

Logging
~~~~~~~

The Elasticsearch Curator Python API uses the standard `logging library`_ from Python.
It inherits two loggers from ``elasticsearch-py``: ``elasticsearch`` and
``elasticsearch.trace``. Clients use the ``elasticsearch`` logger to log
standard activity, depending on the log level. The ``elasticsearch.trace``
logger logs requests to the server in JSON format as pretty-printed ``curl``
commands that you can execute from the command line. The ``elasticsearch.trace``
logger is not inherited from the base logger and must be activated separately.
