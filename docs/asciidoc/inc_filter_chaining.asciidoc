[NOTE]
.Filter chaining
=====================================================================
It is important to note that while filters can be chained, each is linked by an
implied logical *AND* operation.  If you want to match from one of several
different patterns, as with a logical *OR* operation, you can do so with the
<<filtertype_pattern,pattern>> filtertype using _regex_ as the <<fe_kind,kind>>.

This example shows how to select multiple indices based on them beginning with
either `alpha-`, `bravo-`, or `charlie-`:

[source,yaml]
-------------
  filters:
  - filtertype: pattern
    kind: regex
    value: '^(alpha-|bravo-|charlie-).*$'
-------------

Explaining all of the different ways in which regular expressions can be used
is outside the scope of this document, but hopefully this gives you some idea
of how a regular expression pattern can be used when a logical *OR* is desired.
