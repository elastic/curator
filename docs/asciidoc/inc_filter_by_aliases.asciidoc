[IMPORTANT]
.Matching Indices and Aliases
============================
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.5/breaking-changes-5.5.html#breaking_55_rest_changes[Indices must be in all aliases to match].

If a list of <<fe_aliases,aliases>> is provided (instead of only one), indices must appear in _all_
listed <<fe_aliases,aliases>> or a 404 error will result, leading to no indices being matched.
In older versions, if the index was associated with even one of the aliases in
<<fe_aliases,aliases>>, it would result in a match.
