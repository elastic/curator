Curator can be installed in a variety of ways, depending on what meets your
needs.  It is important to note that Curator only requires access to a client
node in the Elasticsearch cluster to work.  It does not need to be installed on
one of the nodes in the cluster.

IMPORTANT: If you plan on using SSL/TLS to connect to Elasticsearch, you may
  encounter issues with older versions of Python and outdated libraries.  The
  binary packages have been compiled with up-to-date versions for your
  convenience. See the <<security,security>> page for more information.

[[pip]]
== pip
This installation procedure utilizes
https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html[python pip], and requires that the
target machine has internet connectivity.

---------------------------------
pip install elasticsearch-curator
---------------------------------

=== Upgrading with pip

If you already have Elasticsearch Curator installed, and want to upgrade to the
latest version, use the `-U` flag:

------------------------------------
pip install -U elasticsearch-curator
------------------------------------

=== Installing a specific version with pip

The `-U` flag uninstalls the current version (if any), then installs the latest
version, or a specified one.  Specify a specific version by adding `==` followed
by the version you'd like to install, like this:

-------------------------------------------
pip install -U elasticsearch-curator==X.Y.Z
-------------------------------------------

=== System-wide vs. User-only installation

The above commands each imply a system-wide installation.  This usually
requires super-user access, or the `sudo` command.  There is a way to install
Curator into a path for just the current user, using the `--user` flag.

----------------------------------------
pip install --user elasticsearch-curator
----------------------------------------

This will result in the `curator` end-point being installed in the current
user's home directory, in the `.local` directory, in the `bin` subdirectory. The
full path might look something like this:

-----------------------------
/home/user/.local/bin/curator
-----------------------------

You can make an alias or a symlink to this so you can call it more easily.

The `--user` flag can also be used in conjunction with the `-U` flag:

----------------------------------------
pip install -U --user elasticsearch-curator==X.Y.Z
----------------------------------------

* https://packages.elastic.co/curator/{curator_major}/debian9/pool/main/e/elasticsearch-curator/elasticsearch-curator_{curator_version}_amd64.deb[Elasticsearch Curator {curator_version} Binary Package for newer Debian 9 based systems (DEB)]

=== Repository Configuration

[IMPORTANT]
====================================================
Debian 9 was recently released, and it uses OpenSSL 1.1.0 libraries, where
earlier releases, including Debian 8, Ubuntu 12.04 - 16.04 LTS, and others
used OpenSSL 1.0.0 libraries.  As a consequence, a new repository has been
introduced, in order to preserve the functionality of the old one, without
causing collisions.

Please use the appropriate package or repository.
====================================================

Add one of the following -- **noting the correct path, `debian` or `debian9`** --
in your `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/` directory in a file with a `.list` suffix,
for example `curator.list`

["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
--------------------------------------------------
deb [arch=amd64] https://packages.elastic.co/curator/{curator_major}/debian stable main
--------------------------------------------------

or

["source","sh",subs="attributes,callouts"]
--------------------------------------------------
deb [arch=amd64] https://packages.elastic.co/curator/{curator_major}/debian9 stable main
--------------------------------------------------

After running `sudo apt-get update`, the repository is ready for use.

[WARNING]
==================================================
Use the file edit method described above to add the Curator repository.  Do not
use `add-apt-repository` as it will add a `deb-src` entry as well, but we do not
provide a source package. If you have added the `deb-src` entry, you will see an
error like the following:

    Unable to find expected entry 'main/source/Sources' in Release file (Wrong sources.list entry or malformed file)

Just delete the `deb-src` entry from the `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/curator.list`
file and the installation should work as expected.
==================================================

[[apt-binary]]
=== Binary Package Installation

The APT version of Curator is a binary version.  What this really means is that
the source is frozen, and all required libraries are bundled with the
`curator` binary, so there are no conflicts.

The packages resulting from the creation process have been tested on Debian 8,
and Ubuntu 12.04, 14.04, & 16.04.  It was also tested on Debian 7, but that
failed due to a libc library mismatch. This binary package may work on other
similar or derivative variants, but they have not been tested.

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------------------
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install elasticsearch-curator
--------------------------------------------------

This will install the necessary files into `/opt/elasticsearch-curator` and
make a symlink at `/usr/bin/curator` that points to the `curator` binary in the
aforementioned directory.

[[yum-repository]]
== YUM repository

Add the following in your `/etc/yum.repos.d/` directory in a file with a `.repo`
suffix, for example `curator.repo`

[WARNING]
========================================
The repositories are different for CentOS/RHEL 6 and 7 due to library and path
differences.  Be sure to use the correct version for your system!

[[yum-binary]]
=== Binary Package Installation

The RPM version of Curator is a binary version.  What this really means is that
the source is frozen, and all required libraries are bundled with the
`curator` binary, so there are no conflicts.

There are separate binary packages for RedHat variants. The binary packages
resulting from the creation process have been tested on CentOS 6 & 7, with a
different binary for each. They may work on similar variants and/or derivatives,
but they have not been tested.

[source,sh]
----------------------------------------
yum install elasticsearch-curator
----------------------------------------

This will install the necessary files into `/opt/elasticsearch-curator` and
make a symlink at `/usr/bin/curator` that points to the `curator` binary in the
aforementioned directory.

[[windows-zip]]
== Windows Binary Zip Package
If you do not wish to install and maintain Python on Windows, there is a
compiled binary version available.  It is in a directory with EXE
files and all necessary libraries that Python requires.  You can navigate to the
directory and run the `curator` command just as you otherwise would.

WARNING: If you do have Python installed, do not uncompress the zip file into
your Python directory.  It can cause library path collisions which will prevent
Curator from properly functioning.

** https://packages.elastic.co/curator/{curator_major}/windows/elasticsearch-curator-{curator_version}-amd64.zip.sha1.txt[SHA1]


[[windows-msi]]
== Windows MSI Installer
There is now a rudimentary MSI installer available.  In previous releases, you could not run a newer version to install over
an older version.  The necessary upgrade code was added in version 5.3.0, which means that MSI upgrades will work when installing
over the top of versions 5.3.0 and up.

The installation will default to `"C:\Program Files\elasticsearch-curator"`.
The same binaries and libraries found in the Windows Binary Package will be installed
into this directory.

[[python-source]]
== Installation from source

Installing or Curator from source is also possible.  In order to do so requires
that all dependent libraries are installed first.

If you have `pip` installed, then you can install from a gzipped file.  If not,
you have to uncompress the gzipped file and run `python setup.py install`.

That might look like this:

[source,sh]
--------------------------------------
wget https://github.com/username/project/archive/#.#.#.tar.gz -O package.tar.gz
tar zxf package.tar.gz
cd package-#.#.#
python setup.py install
--------------------------------------

The dependencies are as follows

=== setuptools

Download https://bootstrap.pypa.io/ez_setup.py[ez_setup.py] and run it using the
target Python version. The script will download the appropriate version and
install it for you:

[source,sh]
-----------
wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/ez_setup.py -O - | python
-----------

Note that you will need to invoke the command with superuser privileges to
install to the system Python:

[source,sh]
-----------
wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/ez_setup.py -O - | sudo python
-----------

Alternatively, setuptools may be installed to a user-local path:

[source,sh]
-----------
wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/ez_setup.py -O - | python - --user
-----------

&nbsp;

=== elasticsearch-curator (python module)
Download and install Curator:

. `wget https://github.com/elastic/curator/archive/v`+pass:attributes[{curator_version}].tar.gz -O elasticsearch-curator.tar.gz+
. `pip install elasticsearch-curator.tar.gz`

or uncompress and run `python setup.py install`.  At this point you could also
run `run_curator.py` from the source directory as well.
