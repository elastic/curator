[[filter_elements]]
= Filter Elements

[[fe_direction]]
== direction

NOTE: This setting is only used with the <<filtertype_age,age>> filtertype, or +
with the <<filtertype_space,space>> filtertype if <<fe_use_age,use_age>> is
set to `True`.

This setting must be either `older` or `younger`. This setting is used to
determine whether the filter should select indices or snapshots that are
`older` or `younger` than the reference point in time determined by
<<fe_unit,unit>>, <<fe_unit_count,unit_count>>, and optionally,
<<fe_epoch,epoch>>.

There is no default value. This setting must be set by the user or an
exception will be raised, and execution will halt.

[[fe_disk_space]]
== disk_space

NOTE: This setting is only used with the <<filtertype_space,space>> filtertype +
    and is a required setting.

The value for this setting is a number of gigabytes.

The <<filtertype_space,space filtertype>> will select indices to delete in
excess of this number of gigabytes.

There is no default value. This setting must be set by the user or an exception
will be raised, and execution will halt.


[[fe_epoch]]
== epoch

NOTE: This setting is only used with the <<filtertype_age,age>> filtertype.

NOTE: This setting is optional.

The value for this setting must be an epoch timestamp.

<<fe_unit,unit>>, <<fe_unit_count,unit_count>>, and optionally,
<<fe_epoch,epoch>>, are used by Curator to establish the moment in time point of
reference with this formula:

[source,sh]
-----------
point_of_reference = epoch - ((number of seconds in unit) * unit_count)
-----------

If <<fe_epoch,epoch>> is unset, the current time is used. It is possible to set
a point of reference in the future by using a negative value for
<<fe_unit_count,unit_count>>.


[[fe_exclude]]
== exclude

NOTE: This setting is only used with the <<filtertype_pattern,pattern>> filtertype.

Setting exclude to `True` inverts the regular pattern match, and instead
_excludes_ matches, keeping the indices or snapshots that do _not_ match the
pattern

The default value for this setting is `False`.


[[fe_field]]
== field

NOTE: This setting is only used with the <<filtertype_age,age>> filtertype.

The value of this setting must be a timestamp field name.  This field must be
present in the indices being filtered or an exception will be raised, and
execution will halt.

This setting is only used when <<fe_source,source>> is `field_stats`.

The default value for this setting is `@timestamp`.



[[fe_kind]]
== kind

NOTE: This setting is only used with the <<filtertype_pattern,pattern>> +
    filtertype and is a required setting.

Acceptable values for this setting are `prefix`, `suffix`, `timestring`, and
`regex`.

There is no default value. This setting must be set by the user or an exception
will be raised, and execution will halt.



[[fe_reverse]]
== reverse

NOTE: This setting is only used with the <<filtertype_space,space>> filtertype

This setting affects the sort order of the indices.  `True` means
reverse-alphabetical.  This means that if all index names share the same pattern
with a date--e.g. index-2016.03.01--older indices will be selected first.

The default value of this setting is `True`.

This setting is ignored if <<fe_use_age,use_age>> is `True`.


[[fe_source]]
== source
The _source_ from which to derive the index or snapshot age. Can be one of
`name`, `creation_date`, or `field_stats`.

NOTE: This setting is only used with the <<filtertype_age,age>> filtertype, or +
with the <<filtertype_space,space>> filtertype if <<fe_use_age,use_age>> is
set to `True`.

NOTE: All source's require <<fe_direction,direction>>, <<fe_unit,unit>>, and +
<<fe_unit_count,unit_count>>. Additionally, each source can use the optional +
setting, <<fe_epoch,epoch>>.

[float]
name
~~~~

Setting source to `name` tells Curator to derive an epoch timestamp from an
index or snapshot name based on a <<fe_timestring,timestring>>.  This was the
only available behavior in previous versions of Curator.

This source requires <<fe_timestring,timestring>> to be set, in additon to <<fe_direction,direction>>,
<<fe_unit,unit>>, and <<fe_unit_count,unit_count>>.

[float]
creation_date
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Setting source to `creation_date` tells Curator to reference the index or
snapshot creation time, as stored in the cluster metadata.

This source requires <<fe_direction,direction>>, <<fe_unit,unit>>, and
<<fe_unit_count,unit_count>>.

[float]
field_stats
~~~~~~~~~~~

Setting source to `field_stats` tells Curator to use a newer Elasticsearch API
call which returns the minimum and maximum value of a field in an index. Curator
will only use timestamp fields, which should be mapped in Elasticsearch as type
`date`.

The <<fe_field,field>> and <<fe_stats_result,stats_result>> settings are
required to use the `field_stats` source.

NOTE: Source `field_stats` only works with indices.

[[fe_stats_result]]
== stats_result

NOTE: This setting is only used with the <<filtertype_age,age>> filtertype.

The value for this setting can be either `min_value` or `max_value`.  This
setting is only used when <<fe_source,source>> is `field_stats`, and determines
whether Curator will use the minimum or maximum value of <<fe_field,field>> for
time calculations.

The default value for this setting is `min_value`.



[[fe_timestring]]
== timestring

NOTE: This setting is only used with the <<filtertype_age,age>> filtertype, or +
with the <<filtertype_space,space>> filtertype if <<fe_use_age,use_age>> is
set to `True`.

This setting must be a valid Python strftime string.  It is used to match and
extract the timestamp in an index name.

The identifiers that Curator currently recognizes include:

* `Y`: A 4 digit year
* `y`: A 2 digit year
* `m`: The 2 digit month
* `W`: The 2 digit week of the year
* `d`: The 2 digit day of the month
* `H`: The 2 digit hour of the day, in 24 hour notation
* `M`: The 2 digit minute of the hour
* `S`: The 2 digit number of second of the minute
* `j`: The 3 digit day of the year

These identifiers may be combined with each other, and/or separated from each
other with hyphens `-`, periods `.`, underscores `_`, or other characters valid
in an index name.

Each identifier must be preceded by a `%` character in the timestring.  For
example, an index like `index-2016.04.01` would use a timestring of
`'%Y.%m.%d'`.

When <<fe_source,source>> is `name`, this setting must be set by the user or an
exception will be raised, and execution will halt. There is no default value.

[[fe_unit]]
== unit

NOTE: This setting is only used with the <<filtertype_age,age>> filtertype, or +
with the <<filtertype_space,space>> filtertype if <<fe_use_age,use_age>> is
set to `True`.

This setting must be one of `seconds`, `minutes`, `hours`, `days`, `weeks`,
`months`, or `years`.

<<fe_unit,unit>>, <<fe_unit_count,unit_count>>, and optionally,
<<fe_epoch,epoch>>, are used by Curator to establish the moment in time point of
reference with this formula:

[source,sh]
-----------
point_of_reference = epoch - ((number of seconds in unit) * unit_count)
-----------

If <<fe_epoch,epoch>> is unset, the current time is used. It is possible to set
a point of reference in the future by using a negative value for
<<fe_unit_count,unit_count>>.

This setting must be set by the user or an exception will be raised, and
execution will halt.

[[fe_unit_count]]
== unit_count

NOTE: This setting is only used with the <<filtertype_age,age>> filtertype, or +
with the <<filtertype_space,space>> filtertype if <<fe_use_age,use_age>> is
set to `True`.

The value of this setting will be used as a multiplier for <<fe_unit,unit>>.

<<fe_unit,unit>>, <<fe_unit_count,unit_count>>, and optionally,
<<fe_epoch,epoch>>, are used by Curator to establish the moment in time point of
reference with this formula:

[source,sh]
-----------
point_of_reference = epoch - ((number of seconds in unit) * unit_count)
-----------

If <<fe_epoch,epoch>> is unset, the current time is used. It is possible to set
a point of reference in the future by using a negative value for
<<fe_unit_count,unit_count>>.

This setting must be set by the user or an exception will be raised, and
execution will halt.

[[fe_use_age]]
== use_age

This setting allows filtering of indices by their age _and_ the space they
consume.  In other words, it sorts all indices in the list by age, then starts
adding the space consumed by each index, beginning from the youngest.  Once the
value of <<fe_disk_space,disk_space>> is reached, all remaining indices, which
are the oldest, will be selected, omitting all of the younger indices.

The default value of this setting is `False`

NOTE: Use of this setting requires the additional setting, <<fe_source,source>>.

[[fe_value]]
== value

NOTE: This setting is only used with the <<filtertype_pattern,pattern>> +
    filtertype and is a required setting.  There is a separate
    <<option_value,value option>> associated with the
    <<allocation,allocation action>>, and the
    <<filtertype_allocated,allocated filtertype>>.

The value of this setting is used by <<fe_kind,kind>> as follows:

* `prefix`: Search the first part of an index name for the provided value
* `suffix`: Search the last part of an index name for the provided value
* `regex`: Provide your own regular expression, and Curator will find the matches.
* `timestring`: An strftime string to extrapolate and find indices that match.
    For example, given a `timestring` of `'%Y.%m.%d'`, matching indices would
    include `logstash-2016.04.01` and `.marvel-2016.04.01`, but not
    `myindex-2016-04-01`, as the pattern is different.

There is no default value. This setting must be set by the user or an exception
will be raised, and execution will halt.
