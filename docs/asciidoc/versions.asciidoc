Elasticsearch Curator has been around for many different versions of Elasticsearch.
Earlier releases of Curator supported multiple versions of Elasticsearch, but this is no longer
the case.

Curator is now major version locked with Elasticsearch, which means that if
Curator's major version is {curator_major}, it should support any Elasticsearch {curator_major}.x
release.
