[[faq_doc_error]]
== Q: How can I report an error in the documentation?

[float]
A: Use the "Edit" link on any page
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See <<site-corrections,Site Corrections>>.

[[faq_partial_delete]]
== Q: Can I delete only certain data from within indices?

[float]
A: It's complicated
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[float]
TL;DR: No. Curator can only delete entire indices.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

[float]
Full answer:
^^^^^^^^^^^^

As a thought exercise, think of Elasticsearch indices as being like databases,
or tablespaces within a database. If you had hundreds of millions of rows to
delete from your database, would you run a separate
`DELETE from TABLE where date<YYYY.MM.dd` to assemble hundreds of millions of
individual delete operations every day, or would you partition your tables in a
way that you could simply run `DROP table TABLENAME.YYYY.MM.dd`? The strain on
your database would be astronomical on the former and next to nothing on the
latter. Elasticsearch works much the same way. While Elasticsearch _can_
technically do both methods, for use-cases with time-series data (like logging),
we recommend dropping entire indices vs. the extremely I/O expensive search and
delete method. Curator was created to help fill that need.

While you can store different types within different indices (e.g.
syslog-2014.05.05, apache-2015.05.06), this gets very expensive, very quickly in
a totally different way. Each shard in Elasticsearch is a Lucene index. Each
index requires a portion of the heap to exist and be kept current. If you have 3
daily indices with 5 primary shards each, you suddenly have reduced the
available heap space for shard management by a factor of 3, having gone from 5
shards to 15, __per index,__ not counting multiple indexes per day. The ways to
mitigate this (if you pursue this route) include massive daily indexing boxes
and using shard allocation/routing to move indices to specific members of the
cluster where they can have less effect; keeping fewer days of information;
having more nodes in your cluster, and so forth.

[float]
Conclusion:
^^^^^^^^^^^

While it may be desirable to have different life-cycles for your data, sometimes
it's just easier and cheaper to store everything as long as the longest
life-cycle you wish to maintain.

[float]
Post-script:
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Even though it is neither recommended*, nor best practices, it is still possible
to perform these search & delete operations yourself, using the Elasticsearch
API. Curator will not be modified to perform operations such as these, however.
Curator is meant to manage at the index level, rather than the data level.

*There are reasons Elasticsearch does not recommend this, particularly for
time-series data. For more information read
http://blog.mikemccandless.com/2011/02/visualizing-lucenes-segment-merges.html
and watch what happens to your segments when you delete data.

[[faq_strange_chars]]
== Q: Can Curator handle index names with strange characters?

[float]
A: Yes!
~~~~~~~

This problem can be resolved by using the
<<filtertype_pattern,pattern filtertype>> with <<fe_kind,kind>> set to `regex`,
and <<fe_value,value>> set to the needed regular expression.

[float]
The Problem:
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Illegal characters make it hard to delete indices.

------------------
% curl logs.example.com:9200/_cat/indices
red    }?ebc-2015.04.08.03
                          sip-request{ 5 1         0  0     632b     316b
red    }?ebc-2015.04.08.03
                          sip-response 5 1         0  0     474b     237b
red    ?ebc-2015.04.08.02
                         sip-request{ 5 1         0  0     474b     316b
red
eb                               5 1         0  0     632b     316b
red    ?e                                5 1         0  0     632b     316b
------------------

&nbsp;

You can see it looks like there are some tab characters and maybe newline
characters. This makes it hard to use the HTTP API to delete the indices.

Dumping all the index settings out:

[source,sh]
-------
curl -XGET localhost:9200/*/_settings?pretty
-------

&nbsp;

...reveals the index names as the first key in the resulting JSON.  In this
case, the names were very atypical:

-------
}\b?\u0011ebc-2015.04.08.02\u000Bsip-request{
}\u0006?\u0011ebc-2015.04.08.03\u000Bsip-request{
}\u0003?\u0011ebc-2015.04.08.03\fsip-response
...
-------

&nbsp;

Curator lets you use regular expressions to select indices to perform actions
on.

WARNING: Before attempting an action, see what will be affected by using the
`--dry-run` flag first.

To delete the first three from the above example, use `'.*sip.*'` as your
regular expression.

NOTE: In an <<actionfile,actionfile>>, regular expressions and strftime date
strings _must_ be encapsulated in single-quotes.

The next one is trickier. The real name of the index was `\n\u0011eb`. The
regular expression `.*b$` did not work, but `'\n.*'` did.

The last index can be deleted with a regular expression of `'.*e$'`.

The resulting <<actionfile,actionfile>> might look like this:

[source,text]
--------
actions:
  1:
    description: Delete indices with strange characters that match regex '.*sip.*'
    action: delete_indices
    options:
      continue_if_exception: False
      disable_action: False
    filters:
    - filtertype: pattern
      kind: regex
      value: '.*sip.*'
  2:
    description: Delete indices with strange characters that match regex '\n.*'
    action: delete_indices
    options:
      continue_if_exception: False
      disable_action: False
    filters:
    - filtertype: pattern
      kind: regex
      value: '\n.*'
  3:
    description: Delete indices with strange characters that match regex '.*e$'
    action: delete_indices
    options:
      continue_if_exception: False
      disable_action: False
    filters:
    - filtertype: pattern
      kind: regex
      value: '.*e$'

[[entrypoint-fix]]
== Q: I'm getting `DistributionNotFound` and `entry_point` errors when I try to run Curator.  What am I doing wrong?

[float]
A: You likely need to upgrade `setuptools`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are still unable to install, or get strange errors about dependencies you
know you've installed, or messages mentioning `entry_point`, you may need to
upgrade the `setuptools` package.  This is especially common with RHEL and
CentOS installs, and their variants, as they depend on Python 2.6.

If you can run `pip install -U setuptools`, it should correct the problem.

You may also be able to download and install manually:

. `wget https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/s/setuptools/setuptools-15.1.tar.gz -O setuptools-15.1.tar.gz`
. `pip install setuptools-15.1.tar.gz`

Any dependencies this version of setuptools may require will have to be manually
acquired and installed for your platform.

For more information about setuptools, see https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools

[[faq_lb_timeout]]
== Q: Snapshots seem to be working. Why am I getting `SnapshotMissingException` messages?

[float]
A: A load balancer, or other network fixture could be timing out your connection.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A gateway, proxy, or load balancer timeout will usually result in
http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html[504 HTTP responses]:

504 Gateway Timeout::
    The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, did not receive a timely
    response from the upstream server specified by the URI (e.g. HTTP, FTP,
    LDAP) or some other auxiliary server (e.g. DNS) it needed to access in
    attempting to complete the request.


An easy way to check is to change the <<loglevel,loglevel>> to DEBUG and look
for 504 errors and long requests, like these:

[source,txt]
-------
2015-04-02 13:18:37,702 DEBUG     urllib3.connectionpool          _make_request:368  "PUT /_snapshot/my_backup_s3_repository/curator-20150402121735?wait_for_completion=true HTTP/1.1" 504 0
2015-04-02 13:18:37,703 WARNING            elasticsearch       log_request_fail:81   PUT /_snapshot/my_backup_s3_repository/curator-20150402121735?wait_for_completion=true [status:504 request:59.777s]
-------

Note the `status:504` and the `request:59.777s` at the right end of the line.

In the case of these error messages, it turned out to be an AWS load balancer
that had a 60 second timeout for connections.  The fix was to increase the
timeout.  Another potential resolution would be to have Curator connect to a
client directly, rather than through a load balancer or proxy.

IMPORTANT: You will need to set <<blacklist,`blacklist: []`>> in your
<<configfile,configuration file>> to catch these 504 errors, as they are
filtered by default.
