Elasticsearch Curator helps you curate, or manage, your Elasticsearch indices
and snapshots by:

1. Obtaining the full list of indices (or snapshots) from the cluster, as the
_actionable list_
2. Iterate through a list of user-defined <<filters,filters>> to progressively
remove indices (or snapshots) from this _actionable list_ as needed.
3. Perform various <<actions,actions>> on the items which remain in the
_actionable list._

[[about-origin]]
== Origin

Curator was first called
https://logstash.jira.com/browse/LOGSTASH-211[`clearESindices.py`].  Its sole
function was to delete indices. It was almost immediately renamed to
https://logstash.jira.com/browse/LOGSTASH-211[`logstash_index_cleaner.py`].
After a time it was briefly relocated under the
https://github.com/elastic/logstash[logstash] repository as
`expire_logs`, at which point it began to gain new functionality.  Soon
thereafter, Jordan Sissel was hired by Elastic (then still Elasticsearch), as
was the original author of Curator.  Not long after that it became Elasticsearch
Curator and is now hosted at https://github.com/elastic/curator

Curator now performs many operations on your Elasticsearch indices, from delete
to snapshot to shard allocation routing.

[[about-features]]
== Features

Curator allows for many different operations to be performed to both indices and
snapshots, including:

* Add or remove indices (or both!) from an <<alias,alias>>
* Change shard routing <<allocation,allocation>>
* <<close,Close>> indices
* <<create_index,Create index>>
* <<delete_indices,Delete indices>>
* <<delete_snapshots,Delete snapshots>>
* <<open,Open>> closed indices
* <<forcemerge,forceMerge>> indices
* <<reindex,reindex>> indices, including from remote clusters
* Change the number of <<replicas,replicas>> per shard for indices
* <<rollover,rollover>> indices
* Take a <<snapshot,snapshot>> (backup) of indices
* <<restore,Restore>> snapshots

[[about-cli]]
== Command-Line Interface (CLI)

Curator has always been a command-line tool. This site provides the
documentation for how to use Curator on the command-line.

TIP: Learn more about <<command-line,the command-line interface>>.

[[about-api]]
== Application Program Interface (API)

Curator ships with both an API and CLI tool.  The API, or Application Program
Interface, allows you to write your own scripts to accomplish similar goals--or
even new and different things--with the same code that Curator uses.

The API documentation is not on this site, but is available at
http://curator.readthedocs.io/.  The Curator API is built using the
http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/python-api/current/index.html[Elasticsearch
Python API].
