Elasticsearch Curator
=====================

The Elasticsearch Curator helps you manage your indices and
snapshots.

.. note::

   This documentation is for Elasticsearch Curator.  Documentation specifically for use of the
   command-line interface -- which uses this API and is installed as an ``entry_point`` as part of
   the package -- is available in the `Elastic guide`_.

.. _Elastic guide: http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/curator/current/index.html

    import curator

    client = elasticsearch8.Elasticsearch()

    ilo = curator.IndexList(client)
    ilo.filter_by_regex(kind='prefix', value='logstash-')
    ilo.filter_by_age(source='name', direction='older', timestring='%Y.%m.%d', unit='days', unit_count=30)
    delete_indices = curator.DeleteIndices(ilo)
    delete_indices.do_action()

Features
********

The API methods fall into the following categories:

* :doc:`Actions </actions>` act on object classes.
* :doc:`IndexList </indexlist>` build and filter a list of indices
* :doc:`SnapshotList </snapshotlist>` build and filter a list of snapshots
* :doc:`Utilities </utilities>` are helper methods.
* :doc:`Validators </validators>` validate configuration schemas.
* :doc:`Defaults </defaults>` constants or functions that return default values

Logging
*******

Elasticsearch Curator uses the standard `logging library`_ from Python.
It inherits two loggers from ``elasticsearch-py``: ``elasticsearch`` and
``elasticsearch.trace``. Clients use the ``elasticsearch`` logger to log
standard activity, depending on the log level. The ``elasticsearch.trace``
logger logs requests to the server in JSON format as pretty-printed ``curl``
commands that you can execute from the command line. The ``elasticsearch.trace``
logger is not inherited from the base logger and must be activated separately.
