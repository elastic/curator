Changelog
=========

4.2.3 (21 November 2016)
------------------------

4.2.2 was pulled immediately after release after it was discovered that the
Windows binary distributions were still not including the certifi-provided
certificates.  This has now been remedied.

**General**

  * ``certifi`` is now officially a requirement.
  * ``setup.py`` now forcibly includes the ``certifi`` certificate PEM file in
    the "frozen" distributions (i.e., the compiled versions).  The
    ``get_client`` method was updated to reflect this and catch it for both the
    Linux and Windows binary distributions.  This should `finally` put to rest
    #810

4.2.2 (21 November 2016)
------------------------

**Bug Fixes**

  * The certifi-provided certificates were not propagating to the compiled
    RPM/DEB packages.  This has been corrected.  Reported in #810 (untergeek)

**General**

  * Added missing ``--ignore_empty_list`` option to singleton actions. Requested
    in #812 (untergeek)

**Documentation**

  * Add a FAQ entry regarding the click module's need for Unicode when using
    Python 3.  Kind of a bug fix too, as the entry_points were altered to catch
    this omission and report a potential solution on the command-line. Reported
    in #814 (untergeek)
  * Change the "Command-Line" documentation header to be "Running Curator"

4.2.1 (8 November 2016)
-----------------------

**Bug Fixes**

  * In the course of package release testing, an undesirable scenario was
    caught where boolean flags default values for ``curator_cli`` were
    improperly overriding values from a yaml config file.

**General**

  * Adding in direct download URLs for the RPM, DEB, tarball and zip packages.

4.2.0 (4 November 2016)
-----------------------

**New Features**

  * Shard routing allocation enable/disable. This will allow you to disable
    shard allocation routing before performing one or more actions, and then
    re-enable after it is complete. Requested in #446 (untergeek)
  * Curator 3.x-style command-line.  This is now ``curator_cli``, to
    differentiate between the current binary.  Not all actions are available,
    but the most commonly used ones are.  With the addition in 4.1.0 of schema
    and configuration validation, there's even a way to still do filter chaining
    on the command-line! Requested in #767, and by many other users (untergeek)

**General**

  * Update testing to the most recent versions.
  * Lock elasticsearch-py module version at >= 2.4.0 and <= 3.0.0.  There are
    API changes in the 5.0 release that cause tests to fail.

**Bug Fixes**

  * Guarantee that binary packages are built from the latest Python + libraries.
    This ensures that SSL/TLS will work without warning messages about insecure
    connections, unless they actually are insecure. Reported in #780, though
    the reported problem isn't what was fixed. The fix is needed based on what
    was discovered while troubleshooting the problem. (untergeek)

4.1.2 (6 October 2016)
----------------------

This release does not actually add any new code to Curator, but instead improves
documentation and includes new linux binary packages.

**General**

  * New Curator binary packages for common Linux systems!
    These will be found in the same repositories that the python-based packages
    are in, but have no dependencies.  All necessary libraries/modules are
    bundled with the binary, so everything should work out of the box.
    This feature doesn't change any other behavior, so it's not a major release.

    These binaries have been tested in:
      * CentOS 6 & 7
      * Ubuntu 12.04, 14.04, 16.04
      * Debian 8

    They do not work in Debian 7 (library mismatch).  They may work in other
    systems, but that is untested.

    The script used is in the unix_packages directory.  The Vagrantfiles for
    the various build systems are in the Vagrant directory.

**Bug Fixes**

  * The only bug that can be called a bug is actually a stray ``.exe`` suffix
    in the binary package creation section (cx_freeze) of ``setup.py``.  The
    Windows binaries should have ``.exe`` extensions, but not unix variants.
  * Elasticsearch 5.0.0-beta1 testing revealed that a document ID is required
    during document creation in tests.  This has been fixed, and a redundant bit
    of code in the forcemerge integration test was removed.

**Documentation**

  * The documentation has been updated and improved.  Examples and installation
    are now top-level events, with the sub-sections each having their own link.
    They also now show how to install and use the binary packages, and the
    section on installation from source has been improved.  The missing
    section on installing the voluptuous schema verification module has been
    written and included. #776 (untergeek)

4.1.1 (27 September 2016)
-------------------------

**Bug Fixes**

  * String-based booleans are now properly coerced.  This fixes an issue where
    `True`/`False` were used in environment variables, but not recognized.
    #765 (untergeek)

  * Fix missing `count` method in ``__map_method`` in SnapshotList. Reported in
    #766 (untergeek)

**General**

  * Update es_repo_mgr to use the same client/logging YAML config file.
    Requested in #752 (untergeek)

**Schema Validation**

  * Cases where ``source`` was not defined in a filter (but should have been)
    were informing users that a `timestring` field was there that shouldn't have
    been.  This edge case has been corrected.

**Documentation**

  * Added notifications and FAQ entry to explain that AWS ES is not supported.

4.1.0 (6 September 2016)
------------------------

**New Features**

  * Configuration and Action file schema validation.  Requested in #674
    (untergeek)
  * Alias filtertype! With this filter, you can select indices based on whether
    they are part of an alias.  Merged in #748 (untergeek)
  * Count filtertype! With this filter, you can now configure Curator to only
    keep the most recent _n_ indices (or snapshots!).  Merged in #749
    (untergeek)
  * Experimental! Use environment variables in your YAML configuration files.
    This was a popular request, #697. (untergeek)

**General**

  * New requirement! ``voluptuous`` Python schema validation module
  * Requirement version bump:  Now requires ``elasticsearch-py`` 2.4.0

**Bug Fixes**

  * ``delete_aliases`` option in ``close`` action no longer results in an error
    if not all selected indices have an alias.  Add test to confirm expected
    behavior. Reported in #736 (untergeek)

**Documentation**

  * Add information to FAQ regarding indices created before Elasticsearch 1.4.
    Merged in #747

4.0.6 (15 August 2016)
----------------------

**Bug Fixes**

  * Update old calls used with ES 1.x to reflect changes in 2.x+. This was
    necessary to work with Elasticsearch 5.0.0-alpha5. Fixed in #728 (untergeek)

**Doc Fixes**

  * Add section detailing that the value of a ``value`` filter element should be
    encapsulated in single quotes. Reported in #726. (untergeek)

4.0.5 (3 August 2016)
---------------------

**Bug Fixes**

  * Fix incorrect variable name for AWS Region reported in #679 (basex)
  * Fix ``filter_by_space()`` to not fail when index age metadata is not
    present.  Indices without the appropriate age metadata will instead be
    excluded, with a debug-level message. Reported in #724 (untergeek)

**Doc Fixes**

  * Fix documentation for the space filter and the source filter element.

4.0.4 (1 August 2016)
---------------------

**Bug Fixes**

  * Fix incorrect variable name in Allocation action. #706 (lukewaite)
  * Incorrect error message in ``create_snapshot_body`` reported in #711
    (untergeek)
  * Test for empty index list object should happen in action initialization for
    snapshot action. Discovered in #711. (untergeek)

**Doc Fixes**

  * Add menus to asciidoc chapters #704 (untergeek)
  * Add pyyaml dependency #710 (dtrv)

4.0.3 (22 July 2016)
--------------------

**General**

  * 4.0.2 didn't work for ``pip`` installs due to an omission in the
    MANIFEST.in file.  This came up during release testing, but before the
    release was fully published. As the release was never fully published, this
    should not have actually affected anyone.

**Bug Fixes**

  * These are the same as 4.0.2, but it was never fully released.
  * All default settings are now values returned from functions instead of
    constants.  This was resulting in settings getting stomped on. New test
    addresses the original complaint.  This removes the need for ``deepcopy``.
    See issue #687 (untergeek)
  * Fix ``host`` vs. ``hosts`` issue in ``get_client()`` rather than the
    non-functional function in ``repomgrcli.py``.
  * Update versions being tested.
  * Community contributed doc fixes.
  * Reduced logging verbosity by making most messages debug level. #684
    (untergeek)
  * Fixed log whitelist behavior (and switched to blacklisting instead).
    Default behavior will now filter traffic from the ``elasticsearch`` and
    ``urllib3`` modules.
  * Fix Travis CI testing to accept some skipped tests, as needed. #695
    (untergeek)
  * Fix missing empty index test in snapshot action. #682 (sherzberg)

4.0.2 (22 July 2016)
--------------------

**Bug Fixes**

  * All default settings are now values returned from functions instead of
    constants.  This was resulting in settings getting stomped on. New test
    addresses the original complaint.  This removes the need for ``deepcopy``.
    See issue #687 (untergeek)
  * Fix ``host`` vs. ``hosts`` issue in ``get_client()`` rather than the
    non-functional function in ``repomgrcli.py``.
  * Update versions being tested.
  * Community contributed doc fixes.
  * Reduced logging verbosity by making most messages debug level. #684
    (untergeek)
  * Fixed log whitelist behavior (and switched to blacklisting instead).
    Default behavior will now filter traffic from the ``elasticsearch`` and
    ``urllib3`` modules.
  * Fix Travis CI testing to accept some skipped tests, as needed. #695
    (untergeek)
  * Fix missing empty index test in snapshot action. #682 (sherzberg)

4.0.1 (1 July 2016)
-------------------

**Bug Fixes**

  * Coerce Logstash/JSON logformat type timestamp value to always use UTC.
    #661 (untergeek)
  * Catch and remove indices from the actionable list if they do not have a
    `creation_date` field in settings.  This field was introduced in ES v1.4, so
    that indicates a rather old index. #663 (untergeek)
  * Replace missing ``state`` filter for ``snapshotlist``. #665 (untergeek)
  * Restore ``es_repo_mgr`` as a stopgap until other CLI scripts are added.  It
    will remain undocumented for now, as I am debating whether to make
    repository creation its own action in the API. #668 (untergeek)
  * Fix dry run results for snapshot action. #673 (untergeek)

4.0.0 (24 June 2016)
--------------------

It's official!  Curator 4.0.0 is released!

**Breaking Changes**

  * New and improved API!
  * Command-line changes.  No more command-line args, except for ``--config``,
    ``--actions``, and ``--dry-run``:

      - ``--config`` points to a YAML client and logging configuration file.
        The default location is ``~/.curator/curator.yml``
      - ``--actions`` arg points to a YAML action configuration file
      - ``--dry-run`` will simulate the action(s) which would have taken place,
        but not actually make any changes to the cluster or its indices.

**New Features**

  * Snapshot restore is here!
  * YAML configuration files.  Now a single file can define an entire batch of
    commands, each with their own filters, to be performed in sequence.
  * Sort by index age not only by index name (as with previous versions of
    Curator), but also by index `creation_date`, or by calculations from the
    Field Stats API on a timestamp field.
  * Atomically add/remove indices from aliases! This is possible by way of the
    new `IndexList` class and YAML configuration files.
  * State of indices pulled and stored in `IndexList` instance.  Fewer API calls
    required to serially test for open/close, `size_in_bytes`, etc.
  * Filter by space now allows sorting by age!
  * Experimental! Use AWS IAM credentials to sign requests to Elasticsearch.
    This requires the end user to *manually* install the `requests_aws4auth`
    python module.
  * Optionally delete aliases from indices before closing.
  * An empty index or snapshot list no longer results in an error if you set
    ``ignore_empty_list`` to `True`.  If `True` it will still log that the
    action was not performed, but will continue to the next action. If 'False'
    it will log an ERROR and exit with code 1.

**API**

  * Updated API documentation
  * Class: `IndexList`. This pulls all indices at instantiation, and you apply
    filters, which are class methods.  You can iterate over as many filters as
    you like, in fact, due to the YAML config file.
  * Class: `SnapshotList`. This pulls all snapshots from the given repository at
    instantiation, and you apply filters, which are class methods.  You can
    iterate over as many filters as you like, in fact, due to the YAML config
    file.
  * Add `wait_for_completion` to Allocation and Replicas actions.  These will
    use the client timeout, as set by default or `timeout_override`, to
    determine how long to wait for timeout.  These are handled in batches of
    indices for now.
  * Allow `timeout_override` option for all actions.  This allows for different
    timeout values per action.
  * Improve API by giving each action its own `do_dry_run()` method.

**General**

  * Updated use documentation for Elastic main site.
  * Include example files for ``--config`` and ``--actions``.

4.0.0b2 (16 June 2016)
----------------------

**Second beta release of the 4.0 branch**

**New Feature**

  * An empty index or snapshot list no longer results in an error if you set
    ``ignore_empty_list`` to `True`.  If `True` it will still log that the
    action was not performed, but will continue to the next action. If 'False'
    it will log an ERROR and exit with code 1. (untergeek)

4.0.0b1 (13 June 2016)

  * Snapshot restore is here!
  * Optionally delete aliases from indices before closing. Fixes #644 (untergeek)

**General**

  * Add `wait_for_completion` to Allocation and Replicas actions.  These will
    use the client timeout, as set by default or `timeout_override`, to
    determine how long to wait for timeout.  These are handled in batches of

---------------------

**General**

  * Changed `create_index` API to use kwarg `extra_settings` instead of `body`
  * Normalized Alias action to use `name` instead of `alias`.  This simplifies
    documentation by reducing the number of option elements.
  * Streamlined some code

**Breaking Changes**

  * New API! (again?!)
  * Command-line changes.  No more command-line args, except for ``--config``,
    ``--actions``, and ``--dry-run``:

      - ``--actions`` arg points to a YAML action configuration file
      - ``--dry-run`` will simulate the action(s) which would have taken place,
        but not actually make any changes to the cluster or its indices.

3.4.0 (28 October 2015)
-----------------------

**General**

  * API change in elasticsearch-py 1.7.0 prevented alias operations.  Fixed in
    #486 (HonzaKral)
  * During index selection you can now select only closed indices with ``--closed-only``.
    Does not impact ``--all-indices`` Reported in #476. Fixed in #487 (Basster)
  * API Changes in Elasticsearch 2.0.0 required some refactoring.  All tests pass
    for ES versions 1.0.3 through 2.0.0-rc1.  Fixed in #488 (untergeek)
  * es_repo_mgr now has access to the same SSL options from #462. #489 (untergeek)

  * Acceptable versions of Elasticsearch-py module are 1.8.0 up to 2.1.0 (untergeek)

3.3.0 (31 August 2015)
----------------------

**Announcement**

  * Curator is tested in Jenkins.  Each commit to the master branch is tested
    with both Python versions 2.7.6 and 3.4.0 against each of the following
    Elasticsearch versions:
    * 1.7_nightly
    * 1.6_nightly
    * 1.7.0
    * 1.6.1
    * 1.5.1
    * 1.4.4
    * 1.3.9
    * 1.2.4
    * 1.1.2
    * 1.0.3
  * If you are using a version different from this, your results may vary.

**General**

  * Allocation type can now also be ``include`` or ``exclude``, in addition to the
    the existing default ``require`` type. Add ``--type`` to the allocation command
    to specify the type. #443 (steffo)

  * Bump elasticsearch python module dependency to 1.6.0+ to enable synced_flush
    API call. Reported in #447 (untergeek)

  * Add SSL features, ``--ssl-no-validate`` and ``certificate`` to provide other
    ways to validate SSL connections to Elasticsearch. #436 (untergeek)

**Bug fixes**

  * Delete by space was only reporting space used by primary shards.  Fixed to
    show all space consumed.  Reported in #455 (untergeek)

  * Update exit codes and messages for snapshot selection.  Reported in #452 (untergeek)

  * Fix potential int/float casting issues. Reported in #465 (untergeek)

3.2.3 (16 July 2015)
--------------------

**Bug fix**

  * In order to address customer and community issues with bulk deletes, the
    ``master_timeout`` is now invoked for delete operations.  This should address
    503s with 30s timeouts in the debug log, even when ``--timeout`` is set to
    a much higher value.  The ``master_timeout`` is tied to the ``--timeout``
    flag value, but will not exceed 300 seconds. #420 (untergeek)

**General**

  * Mixing it up a bit here by putting `General` second!  The only other changes
    are that logging has been improved for deletes so you won't need to have the
    ``--debug`` flag to see if you have error codes >= 400, and some code
    documentation improvements.

3.2.2 (13 July 2015)
--------------------

**General**

  * This is a very minor change.  The ``mock`` library recently removed support
    for Python 2.6.  As many Curator users are using RHEL/CentOS 6, which is
    pinned to Python 2.6, this requires the mock version referenced by Curator
    to also be pinned to a supported version (``mock==1.0.1``).

3.2.1 (10 July 2015)
--------------------

**General**

  * Added delete verification & retry (fixed at 3x) to potentially cover an edge
    case in #420 (untergeek)
  * Since GitHub allows rST (reStructuredText) README documents, and that's what
    PyPI wants also, the README has been rebuilt in rST. (untergeek)

**Bug fixes**

  * If closing indices with ES 1.6+, and all indices are closed, ensure that the
    seal command does not try to seal all indices.  Reported in #426 (untergeek)
  * Capture AttributeError when sealing indices if a non-TransportError occurs.
    Reported in #429 (untergeek)

3.2.0 (25 June 2015)
--------------------

**New!**

  * Added support to manually seal, or perform a [synced flush](http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-synced-flush.html)
    on indices with the ``seal`` command. #394 (untergeek)
  * Added *experimental* support for SSL certificate validation.  In order for
    this to work, you must install the ``certifi`` python module:
    ``pip install certifi``
    This feature *should* automatically work if the ``certifi`` module is
    installed.  Please report any issues.

**General**

  * Changed logging to go to stdout rather than stderr.  Reopened #121 and
    figured they were right.  This is better. (untergeek)
  * Exit code 99 was unpopular.  It has been removed. Reported in #371 and #391
    (untergeek)
  * Add ``--skip-repo-validation`` flag for snapshots.  Do not validate write
    access to repository on all cluster nodes before proceeding. Useful for
    shared filesystems where intermittent timeouts can affect validation, but
    won't likely affect snapshot success. Requested in #396 (untergeek)
  * An alias no longer needs to be pre-existent in order to use the alias
    command.  #317 (untergeek)
  * es_repo_mgr now passes through upstream errors in the event a repository
    fails to be created.  Requested in #405 (untergeek)

**Bug fixes**

 * In rare cases, ``*`` wildcard would not expand.  Replaced with _all.
   Reported in #399 (untergeek)
 * Beginning with Elasticsearch 1.6, closed indices cannot have their replica
   count altered.  Attempting to do so results in this error:
   ``org.elasticsearch.ElasticsearchIllegalArgumentException: Can't update [index.number_of_replicas] on closed indices [[test_index]] - can leave index in an unopenable state``
   As a result, the ``change_replicas`` method has been updated to prune closed
   indices.  This change will apply to all versions of Elasticsearch.
   Reported in #400 (untergeek)
 * Fixed es_repo_mgr repository creation verification error. Reported in #389
   (untergeek)



3.1.0 (21 May 2015)
-------------------

**General**

 * If ``wait_for_completion`` is true, snapshot success is now tested and logged.
   Reported in #253 (untergeek)
 * Log & return false if a snapshot is already in progress (untergeek)
 * Logs individual deletes per index, even though they happen in batch mode.
   Also log individual snapshot deletions. Reported in #372 (untergeek)
 * Moved ``chunk_index_list`` from cli to api utils as it's now also used by ``filter.py``
 * Added a warning and 10 second timer countdown if you use ``--timestring`` to filter
   indices, but do not use ``--older-than`` or ``--newer-than`` in conjunction with it.
   This is to address #348, which behavior isn't a bug, but prevents accidental
   action against all of your time-series indices.  The warning and timer are
   not displayed for ``show`` and ``--dry-run`` operations.
 * Added tests for ``es_repo_mgr`` in #350
 * Doc fixes

**Bug fixes**

 * delete-by-space needed the same fix used for #245. Fixed in #353 (untergeek)
 * Increase default client timeout for ``es_repo_mgr`` as node discovery and
   availability checks for S3 repositories can take a bit.  Fixed in #352 (untergeek)
 * If an index is closed, indicate in ``show`` and ``--dry-run`` output.
   Reported in #327. (untergeek)
 * Fix issue where CLI parameters were not being passed to the ``es_repo_mgr``
   create sub-command.
   Reported in #337. (feltnerm)

3.0.3 (27 Mar 2015)
-------------------

**Announcement**

This is a bug fix release. #319 and #320 are affecting a few users, so this
release is being expedited.

Test count: 228
Code coverage: 99%

**General**

 * Documentation for the CLI converted to Asciidoc and moved to
   http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/curator/current/index.html
 * Improved logging, and refactored a few methods to help with this.
 * Dry-run output is now more like v2, with the index or snapshot in the log
   line, along with the command.  Several tests needed refactoring with this
   change, along with a bit of documentation.

**Bug fixes**

 * Fix links to repository in setup.py. Reported in #318 (untergeek)
 * No more ``--delay`` with optimized indices. Reported in #319 (untergeek)
 * ``--request_timeout`` not working as expected.  Reinstate the version 2
   timeout override feature to prevent default timeouts for ``optimize`` and
   ``snapshot`` operations. Reported in #320 (untergeek)
 * Reduce index count to 200 for
   test.integration.test_cli_commands.TestCLISnapshot.test_cli_snapshot_huge_list
   in order to reduce or eliminate Jenkins CI test timeouts.
   Reported in #324 (untergeek)
 * ``--dry-run`` no longer calls ``show``, but will show output in the log, as
   in v2. This was a recurring complaint.  See #328 (untergeek)


3.0.2 (23 Mar 2015)
-------------------

**Announcement**

This is a bug fix release.  #307 and #309 were big enough to warrant an
expedited release.

**Bug fixes**

 * Purge unneeded constants, and clean up config options for snapshot. Reported in #303 (untergeek)
 * Don't split large index list if performing snapshots. Reported in #307 (untergeek)
 * Act correctly if a zero value for `--older-than` or `--newer-than` is provided. #309 (untergeek)

3.0.1 (16 Mar 2015)
-------------------

**Announcement**

The ``regex_iterate`` method was horribly named.  It has been renamed to
``apply_filter``.  Methods have been added to allow API users to build a
filtered list of indices similarly to how the CLI does.  This was an oversight.
Props to @SegFaultAX for pointing this out.

**General**

 * In conjunction with the rebrand to Elastic, URLs and documentation were updated.
 * Renamed horribly named `regex_iterate` method to `apply_filter` #298 (untergeek)
 * Added `build_filter` method to mimic CLI calls. #298 (untergeek)
 * Added Examples page in the API documentation. #298 (untergeek)

**Bug fixes**

 * Refactored to show `--dry-run` info for `--disk-space` calls. Reported in
   #290 (untergeek)
 * Added list chunking so acting on huge lists of indices won't result in a URL
   bigger than 4096 bytes (Elasticsearch's default limit.)  Reported in
   https://github.com/elastic/curator/issues/245#issuecomment-77916081
 * Refactored `to_csv()` method to be simpler.
 * Added and removed tests according to changes.  Code coverage still at 99%

3.0.0 (9 March 2015)
--------------------

**Release Notes**

The full release of Curator 3.0 is out!  Check out all of the changes here!

*Note:* This release is _not_ reverse compatible with any previous version.

Because 3.0 is a major point release, there have been some major changes to both
the API as well as the CLI arguments and structure.

Be sure to read the updated command-line specific docs in the
[wiki](https://github.com/elasticsearch/curator/wiki) and change your
command-line arguments accordingly.

The API docs are still at http://curator.readthedocs.io.  Be sure to read the
latest docs, or select the docs for 3.0.0.

**General**

 * **Breaking changes to the API.**  Because this is a major point revision,
   changes to the API have been made which are non-reverse compatible.  Before
   upgrading, be sure to update your scripts and test them thoroughly.
 * **Python 3 support** Somewhere along the line, Curator would no longer work
   with curator.  All tests now pass for both Python2 and Python3, with 99% code
   coverage in both environments.
 * **New CLI library.** Using Click now. http://click.pocoo.org/3/
   This change is especially important as it allows very easy CLI integration
   testing.
 * **Pipelined filtering!** You can now use ``--older-than`` & ``--newer-than``
   in the same command!  You can also provide your own regex via the ``--regex``
   parameter.  You can use multiple instances of the ``--exclude`` flag.
 * **Manually include indices!** With the ``--index`` paramter, you can add an
   index to the working list.  You can provide multiple instances of the
   ``--index`` parameter as well!
 * **Tests!** So many tests now.  Test coverage of the API methods is at 100%
   now, and at 99% for the CLI methods.  This doesn't mean that all of the tests
   are perfect, or that I haven't missed some scenarios.  It does mean, however,
   that it will be much easier to write tests if something turns up missed.  It
   also means that any new functionality will now need to have tests.
 * **Iteration changes** Methods now only iterate through each index when
   appropriate!  In fact, the only commands that iterate are `alias` and
   `optimize`.  The `bloom` command will iterate, but only if you have added the
   `--delay` flag with a value greater than zero.
 * **Improved packaging!**  Methods have been moved into categories of
   ``api`` and ``cli``, and further broken out into individual modules to help
   them be easier to find and read.
 * Check for allocation before potentially re-applying an allocation rule.
   #273 (ferki)
 * Assigning replica count and routing allocation rules _can_ be done to closed
   indices. #283 (ferki)

**Bug fixes**

 * Don't accidentally delete ``.kibana`` index. #261 (malagoli)
 * Fix segment count for empty indices. #265 (untergeek)
 * Change bloom filter cutoff Elasticsearch version to 1.4. Reported in #267
   (untergeek)

3.0.0rc1 (5 March 2015)
-----------------------

**Release Notes**

RC1 is here!  I'm re-releasing the Changes from all betas here, minus the
intra-beta code fixes.  Barring any show stoppers, the official release will be
soon.

**General**

 * **Breaking changes to the API.**  Because this is a major point revision,
   changes to the API have been made which are non-reverse compatible.  Before
   upgrading, be sure to update your scripts and test them thoroughly.

   will be addressed by this.  Methods have been moved into categories of
   ``api`` and ``cli``, and further broken out into individual modules to help
   them be easier to find and read.
 * Check for allocation before potentially re-applying an allocation rule.
   #273 (ferki)

   indices. #283 (ferki)

**Bug fixes**

 * Change bloom filter cutoff Elasticsearch version to 1.4. Reported in #267
   (untergeek)


3.0.0b4 (5 March 2015)
----------------------

**Notes**

Integration testing!  Because I finally figured out how to use the Click
Testing API, I now have a good collection of command-line simulations,
complete with a real back-end.  This testing found a few bugs (this is why
testing exists, right?), and fixed a few of them.

**Bug fixes**

 * HUGE! `curator show snapshots` would _delete_ snapshots.  This is fixed.
 * Return values are now being sent from the commands.
 * `scripttest` is no longer necessary (click.Test works!)
 * Calling `get_snapshot` without a snapshot name returns all snapshots


3.0.0b3 (4 March 2015)
----------------------

**Bug fixes**

 * setup.py was lacking the new packages "curator.api" and "curator.cli"  The
   package works now.
 * Python3 suggested I had to normalize the beta tag to just b3, so that's also
   changed.
 * Cleaned out superfluous imports and logger references from the __init__.py
   files.

3.0.0-beta2 (3 March 2015)
--------------------------

**Bug fixes**

 * Python3 issues resolved.  Tests now pass on both Python2 and Python3

3.0.0-beta1 (3 March 2015)
--------------------------

**General**

 * **Breaking changes to the API.**  Because this is a major point revision,
   changes to the API have been made which are non-reverse compatible.  Before
   upgrading, be sure to update your scripts and test them thoroughly.
 * **New CLI library.** Using Click now. http://click.pocoo.org/3/
 * **Pipelined filtering!** You can now use ``--older-than`` & ``--newer-than``
   in the same command!  You can also provide your own regex via the ``--regex``
   parameter.  You can use multiple instances of the ``--exclude`` flag.
 * **Manually include indices!** With the ``--index`` paramter, you can add an
   index to the working list.  You can provide multiple instances of the
   ``--index`` parameter as well!
 * **Tests!** So many tests now.  Unit test coverage of the API methods is at
   100% now.  This doesn't mean that all of the tests are perfect, or that I
   haven't missed some scenarios.  It does mean that any new functionality will
   need to also have tests, now.
 * Methods now only iterate through each index when appropriate!
 * Improved packaging!  Hopefully the ``entry_point`` issues some users have had
   will be addressed by this.  Methods have been moved into categories of
   ``api`` and ``cli``, and further broken out into individual modules to help
   them be easier to find and read.
 * Check for allocation before potentially re-applying an allocation rule.
   #273 (ferki)
