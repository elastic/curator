    action: forcemerge
    description: >-
      forceMerge logstash- prefixed indices older than 2 days (based on index
      creation_date) to 2 segments per shard.  Delay 120 seconds between each
      forceMerge operation to allow the cluster to quiesce.
      This action will ignore indices already forceMerged to the same or fewer
      number of segments per shard, so the 'forcemerged' filter is unneeded.

      max_num_segments: 2
      delay: 120
      timeout_override:
      continue_if_exception: False
      disable_action: True
