# Curator

Have time-series indices in Elasticsearch? This is the tool for you!

## Versioning

There are two branches for development - `master` and `0.6`. Master branch is
used to track all the changes for Elasticsearch 1.0 and beyond whereas 0.6
tracks Elasticsearch 0.90 and the corresponding `elasticsearch-py` version.

Releases with major version 1 (1.X.Y) are to be used with Elasticsearch 1.0 and
later, 0.6 releases are meant to work with Elasticsearch 0.90.X.

## Usage

Install using pip

    pip install elasticsearch-curator


See `curator --help` for usage specifics.

### Defaults

The default values for host, port and prefix are:

    --host localhost
    --port 9200
    -t (or --timeout) 30
    -C (or --curation-style) time
    -T (or --time-unit) days
    -p (or --prefix) logstash-
    -s (or --separator) .
    --max_num_segments 2

If your values match these you do not need to include them.  The `prefix` should be everything before the date string.

### Examples

Close indices older than 14 days, delete indices older than 30 days (See https://github.com/elasticsearch/curator/issues/1):

    curator --host my-elasticsearch -d 30 -c 14

Keep 14 days of logs in elasticsearch:

    curator --host my-elasticsearch -d 14

Disable bloom filter for indices older than 2 days, close indices older than 14 days, delete indices older than 30 days:

    curator --host my-elasticsearch -b 2 -c 14 -d 30
    
Optimize (Lucene forceMerge) indices older than 2 days to 1 segment per shard:

    curator --host my-elasticsearch -t 3600 -o 2 --max_num_segments 1

Keep 1TB of data in elasticsearch, show debug output:

    curator --host my-elasticsearch -C space -g 1024 -D

Note that when using size to determine which indices to keep having closed
indices will cause inaccuracies since they cannot be added to the overall size.
This is only an issue if you have closed some indices that are not your oldest
ones.

Dry run of above:

    curator --host my-elasticsearch -C space -g 1024 -D -n

Add routing information `index.routing.allocation.key=value` to indices older than 2 days:

    curator --host my-elasticsearch -r 2 --required_rule key=value

Note that any arbitrary key and value can be used.  However it must match an existing key and value in your Elasticsearch configuration *for some node(s)* in order for the routing/reallocation to occur.

## Documentation and Errata

If you need to close and delete based on different criteria, please use separate command lines, e.g.

    curator --host my-elasticsearch -C space -g 1024
    curator --host my-elasticsearch -c 15
    
When using optimize the current behavior is to wait until the optimize operation is complete before continuing.  With large indices, this can result in timeouts with the default 30 seconds.  It is recommended that you increase the timeout to at least 3600 seconds, if not more.  

## Cron and logstash

Common practice is to run curator as a cron job, e.g.

    20 0 * * * /usr/local/bin/curator -c 30 -d 60 |& nc localhost 28778

Then logstash can be configured using:

    input {
      tcp {
        type => "curator"
        port => "28778"
      }
    }
    filter {
      if [type] == "curator" {
        grok {
          match => {
            "message" => "%{TIMESTAMP_ISO8601:timestamp} %{WORD:level}%{SPACE}%{WORD:function}:%{POSINT:line}%{SPACE}%{GREEDYDATA:description}"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    
## Contributing

* fork the repo
* make changes in your fork
* run tests
* send a pull request!

### Running tests

To run the test suite just run `python setup.py test`.

When changing code, contributing new code or fixing a bug please make sure you
include tests in your PR (or mark it as without tests so that someone else can
pick it up to add the tests). When fixing a bug please make sure the test
actually tests the bug - it should fail without the code changes and pass after
they're applied (it can still be one commit of course).

The tests will try to connect to your local elasticsearch instance and run
integration tests against it. This will delete all the data stored there! You
can use the env variable `TEST_ES_SERVER` to point to a different instance (for
example 'otherhost:9203').
