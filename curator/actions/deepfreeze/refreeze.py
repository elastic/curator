class Refreeze:
    """
    The Refreeze action is a user-initiated operation to signal "I'm done with this thaw."
    It unmounts repositories that were previously thawed and resets them back to frozen state.

    Unlike the automatic Cleanup action which processes expired repositories on a schedule,
    Refreeze is explicitly invoked by users when they're finished accessing thawed data,
    even if the S3 restore hasn't expired yet.

    When you thaw from AWS Glacier, you get a temporary restored copy that exists for a
    specified duration. After that expires, AWS automatically removes the temporary copy -
    the original Glacier object never moved. Refreeze doesn't push anything back; it's about
    unmounting the repositories and resetting state.
